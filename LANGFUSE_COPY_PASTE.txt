LANGFUSE PROMPT - COPY & PASTE FIELDS (v3.1 - Updated 2025-10-03)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🆕 VERSION 3.1 CRITICAL FIXES (CONSERVATIVE MODE):
✅ PLAAFP expands ONLY what teacher explicitly mentions (no inference)
✅ Accommodations STRICTLY limited to selected list (no additions)
✅ Goals created ONLY for areas in PLAAFP (no orphan goals)
✅ Services aligned 1:1 with goals (no extras)
✅ Sections reference ONLY mentioned areas (no cross-contamination)
✅ Conservative auto-detection (functional goals only if explicitly stated)

⚠️ KEY BEHAVIOR CHANGES FROM v3.0:
- If teacher mentions ONLY reading → IEP discusses ONLY reading (no math, writing, attention)
- Selected accommodations = ALL accommodations (no "helpful additions")
- Each section strictly reflects teacher's original input

Even if not in {{priorityGoalAreas}}, if PLAAFP mentions ANY of these, automatically create a corresponding goal:
- Attention/focus issues → Create "Attention & Focus" goal
- Organization problems → Create "Organization & Task Completion" goal
- Task completion challenges → Create "Task Completion" or "Self-Regulation" goal
- Behavioral concerns → Create "Self-Regulation & Behavior" goal

**SMART Criteria:**
- **S**pecific: Clearly defined, addressing EXACT challenges from PLAAFP (NOT vague like "improve reading")
- **M**easurable: Include concrete metrics (80% accuracy, 4 out of 5 trials, grade level)
- **A**chievable: Realistic given student's CURRENT level from PLAAFP
- **R**elevant: Directly addresses documented needs and areas of concern
- **T**ime-bound: Clear deadline matching {{evaluationSchedule}}

**Goal Structure:**
- Create ONE goal for EACH priority goal area in: {{priorityGoalAreas}}
- PLUS additional goals for any needs mentioned in PLAAFP not covered above
- Format: "Goal 1: [Goal Area Name]"
- Each goal must have 3-4 short-term benchmarks

**Benchmark Requirements:**
- Each benchmark MUST follow SMART criteria
- Progressive difficulty: 60% → 70% → 75% → 80-90%
- Reference accommodations: {{accommodations}}
- Timeframes aligned with {{evaluationSchedule}}:
  - Annually: Fall semester → Winter break → Spring semester → End of year
  - Quarterly: Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4
  - Weekly: Week 1-4 → Week 5-8 → Week 9-12 → Week 13-16
  - Bi-weekly: Weeks 1-2 → Weeks 3-4 → Weeks 5-6 → Weeks 7-8

**Example SMART Goals:**

*Academic Goal:*
"By the end of the school year, [Student name] will improve reading comprehension by accurately answering inferential and main idea questions in 6th-grade texts with 80% accuracy in 4 out of 5 opportunities, using graphic organizers."

*Functional Goal (if PLAAFP mentions attention):*
"By the end of Q4, [Student name] will independently remain on task during independent work for 15 minutes with no more than one prompt, in 4 out of 5 opportunities."

*Writing Goal (if PLAAFP mentions writing):*
"By the end of the school year, [Student name] will independently organize a 5-sentence paragraph with clear topic sentence, 3 supporting details, and conclusion, scoring 3 or higher on a 4-point rubric in 4 out of 5 writing tasks."

📊 TESTE EXEMPLO (CASO TODD - v3.0)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Após criar o prompt no Langfuse, testar com estes valores:

studentPerformance = "Todd, a fourth grader, currently reads 85 words per minute with 5 errors when given a first semester, second grade-level passage. According to district norms, Todd is reading at the 5th percentile for fourth graders in the fall. He has difficulty organizing his thoughts in writing and struggles with multi-step math problems. Todd requires frequent reminders to stay on task and benefits from visual supports."

gradeLevel = "4th Grade"

language = "English"

evaluationSchedule = "Quarterly"

disabilityCategories = "Specific Learning Disability (SLD)"

areasOfConcern = "Academic (reading, writing, math)"

priorityGoalAreas = "Reading Comprehension"

existingServices = "Special Education Teacher Support"

accommodations = "Extended time, Visual aids/graphic organizers"

iepComponents = "student-info, plaafp, disability-categories, areas-concern, priority-goals, goals, accommodations-mods, progress, gen-ed, services, team"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔍 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR v3.1 CONSERVATIVE (Caso Todd):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Com este exemplo, o sistema v3.1 DEVE (MODO CONSERVADOR):

✅ PLAAFP com dados objetivos APENAS para área mencionada:
   - Reading: "85 WPM, 5 errors, 2nd grade level, 5th percentile"
   - Strengths: "responds to visual aids and graphic organizers"
   - Impact: "affects access to reading-intensive subjects"
   ❌ SEM Writing (não mencionado no input)
   ❌ SEM Math (não mencionado no input)
   ❌ SEM Attention/Focus (não mencionado no input)

✅ Criar APENAS 1 META (conservador):
   1. Reading Comprehension (explícito em priorityGoalAreas)
   ❌ NÃO criar Writing goal (não mencionado)
   ❌ NÃO criar Math goal (não mencionado)
   ❌ NÃO criar Attention goal (não mencionado)

✅ ACCOMMODATIONS usando APENAS lista selecionada:
   Reading: Visual aids/graphic organizers, Extended time
   Assessments: Extended time, Visual aids
   ❌ SEM "Frequent breaks" (não selecionado)
   ❌ SEM "Modified assessments" (não selecionado)
   ❌ SEM categoria Writing (reading não mencionado no PLAAFP)

✅ SERVIÇOS alinhados 1:1 com a 1 meta (tabela com 4 colunas):
   - Reading Comprehension Intervention | 3x/week, 45min | Pull-out (Resource Room) | Sp Ed Teacher
   ❌ SEM Writing Support
   ❌ SEM Math Intervention
   ❌ SEM Executive Function Coaching

✅ Progress Monitoring APENAS para Reading

✅ Participation menciona APENAS reading-intensive subjects
   "requires support in reading-intensive subjects such as language arts and content area reading"
   ❌ SEM menção a "math" 
   ❌ SEM menção a "writing"

- IEP_GENERATOR_IMPROVEMENTS_V3.md → Documentação das melhorias v3.0
- LANGFUSE_IEP_PROMPT.json → Versão estruturada do prompt (v3.1 CONSERVATIVE)
- IEP_PROMPT_STRUCTURE.json → Estrutura detalhada (pendente atualização)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚖️ DIFERENÇAS v3.0 vs v3.1
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

v3.0 (PROATIVO):
❌ Inferia problemas não mencionados
❌ Adicionava accommodations "úteis"
❌ Criava metas para áreas não citadas
❌ Mencionava math/writing mesmo sem input

v3.1 (CONSERVADOR):
✅ Expande APENAS o que foi dito
✅ Usa APENAS accommodations selecionadas
✅ Cria metas APENAS para áreas do PLAAFP
✅ Seções referem APENAS áreas mencionadas

QUANDO USAR:
- v3.1: Quando input é minimalista (ex: só reading)
- v3.1: Quando quer controle estrito sobre output
- v3.1: Quando precisa de IEP focado em 1-2 áreas

EXEMPLO PRÁTICO:
Input: "Todd reads at 2nd grade level (85 WPM, 5 errors)"
- v3.0: Cria 4 metas (reading, writing, math, attention) ❌
- v3.1: Cria 1 meta (reading) ✅
